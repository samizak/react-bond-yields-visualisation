# React Bond-Yield Visualization
A 3D interactive chart to visualize the change in US Treasury bond yields over time, created with [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) and bootstrapped with Create React App

The historic data for US Treasury yields was downloaded from [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), and compiled into a CSV file (which can be found in the `data` folder).
